BUILDING THE REACT APP
- Open a cmd terminal in clientside repo
- NOTE: Frontend and Backend repo folders must be in the same place (E.G. Both in desktop)
- Make sure you have nodejs installed
- 'npm i'
- 'npm run build'

TESTING THE APP
- Use npm run start to open a development environment
- This will make changes show up in realtime
- NOTE: The backend will still serve the last build, but the development environment should still be able to make backend requests
